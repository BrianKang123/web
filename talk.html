 <h1 style="color: blue;">  My Favorite Chess Pieces and Why! </h1>
  <ul>
  <li> Bishop </li>
  <li> Queen </li>
  <li> King </li>
  </ul>
 <h2 style="color: red;"> Bishop </h2>
  <p> Although this piece is worth 3 points, which is two fewer points than the rook, which won’t be mentioned here, the bishop is worth more from the early to mid-game with its control on the board.
  The rook only makes its impact towards the end of the game. You may be thinking that a piece that captures by columns has more impact than one that captures diagonally.
  However, diagonals are putting more pressure and less visible to the enemy’s eye than captures by column. </p>   
   <h2 style="color: red;">  Queen </h2>
  <p> The queen tends to be the most valuable piece in everyone’s eyes and I agree with this. 
  The queen can basically move like other pieces except for the knight and tends to be the most protected, second to the king. 
  Usually, games are ended with the use of the queen and most stunning yet, but the sacrifice of the queen that people don’t anticipate. 
  People would think that the entire game you would have to constantly save the most important piece, but to a good player, they will do anything to win a game and I mean anything. This makes the queen worth 9 points. </p>  
 <h2 style="color: red;"> King </h2>
  <p> The king is the most valuable piece on the board as if you lose it, you lose the game. 
    Although the king may seem weak by only being able to move one square per turn, the general game plan is to first protect your king by castling either the king or queenside than moving forward with your attack. 
    ALWAYS remember to refer to the position of your king and question why your opponent made each move. 
    Any piece is or can eventually become a threat to the king. 
    The king is therefore worth infinite points because once again, you lose without the king. </p>
